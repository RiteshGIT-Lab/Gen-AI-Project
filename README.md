## Project Title: Restaurant Tipping Data Analysis using Python

 In this project, I performed data loading, cleaning, and visualization using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) inside VS Code.
The notebook (Tips_Analysis.ipynb) contains all the step-by-step code for data exploration and analysis, including charts such as:
•	Scatter Plot: Total Bill vs Tip
•	Average Tip by Day (Bar Chart)
•	Boxplots for Gender and Smoker comparison
•	Tip Percentage vs Total Bill
•	Correlation Heatmap
